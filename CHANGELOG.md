# Changelog

A clone is a detached copy: once you make your stack from this template, nothing tells you an
upgrade exists or what it changed. This file is that signal. **Watch releases** on the upstream
template repo (GitHub: the repo's "Watch" button, "Custom" then "Releases"), and each release maps
to one entry below. When a release lands, open this file and read every entry newer than your own
`STACK_VERSION`.

Each entry is classified. **additive-doc** upgrades add or extend documents and need no interview:
copy the listed files into your stack, translating template names to your own renames as you go
(same rule as the install, a doc that references a sphere or agent by the template's name should
arrive speaking yours). **structural** upgrades add layers or change how pieces wire together: open
your stack beside a fresh copy of the new template and run the upgrade interview in `UPGRADING.md`,
which reads your `STACK_VERSION`, works out which entries below apply, and walks you through them.

## v2.3 (2026-07-02): additive-doc

The memory layer gains a named fourth organ.

- **`clocktower/connector-doctrine.md`** (new): the connector, a daily job that reads the new
  learning-material delta through a current-context lens and emits a tiny number of high-precision
  "this idea maps to that live problem" connections. Names the four memory organs: intake, carder,
  gate, connector.
- **`rules/OPERATING.md`**: four laws added to the pipelines-and-observability section (deploy before
  backfill, alert delivery vs salience, bound-the-walk startup starvation, heartbeat-is-an-upsert).
  Merge them beside your own; do not clobber your pruned steering rules.
- **`README.md`**: the clocktower layer bullet now names the four organs and points at the new doc.
- **Apply:** copy the connector doctrine in clean; merge the OPERATING and README deltas.

## v2.2 (2026-07-02): additive-doc

- **`soul/character-craft.md`** (new): the persona-authoring craft, distilled character-free
  (archetypes, trait tensions, tone proofs, the named failure mode).
- **`INSTALL.md`**: Phase 2 gains the archetype question up front.
- **Apply:** copy the craft doc in; merge the INSTALL delta if you have not personalized that file.

## v2.1 (2026-07-02): additive-doc

- **`UPGRADING.md`**: reframed from a static doc into an agent-run interview.
- **`agents/RETHEME.md`** (new): the roster re-theming interview, rebuild the agents in your own
  mythology with the dispatch doctrine kept intact. Bring your own gods.
- **Apply:** copy `agents/RETHEME.md` in; adopt the new `UPGRADING.md` flow.

## v2 (2026-07-02): structural

The four-layer template became six, plus the rules half and the public-hardening pass.

- **`hooks/`** (new layer): the loops, doctrine plus minimal file-backed reference implementations
  (session-start briefing, heartbeat, voice integrity, safety rails, dispatch routing).
- **`skills/`** (new layer): session-lifecycle slash commands (`/end`, `/handoff`, `/sessions`,
  `/evolve`, `/muninn`) plus the doctrine for writing your own.
- **`rules/OPERATING.md`** (new): the conduct half of the soul split, action bias, the miss-capture
  protocol, steering rules, strategy rating, production and pipeline standards.
- **`clocktower/retrieval-doctrine.md`** (new): production-earned rules that make retrieval good.
- **`UPGRADING.md`**, **`LICENSE`** (MIT), and the public-hardening pass on `SCRUB.md`.
- **Apply:** structural. Run the upgrade interview, it adds the new layers without touching your
  owned files.

## v1 (2026-06-19): structural

Initial release: the four founding layers, `brain/`, `soul/`, `clocktower/`, `agents/`, with the
brain laws and the scoped-by-sphere shape. If your stack predates `STACK_VERSION`, you are here.
